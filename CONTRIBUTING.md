# Raising an issue here

### Has someone else raised the issue?
Check through currently open AND closed issues. If the issue has already been raised, please comment on the existing one.

### It doesn't work
"It doesn't work" doesn't help anyone solve your problem. What doesn't work?

+ It didn't compile?
+ It crashed?
+ It didn't show the correct Reachability state?

### It won't compile
If it won't compile, what error messages are you seeing? Include the code that's at fault - a screen shot might help here.

### It crashed
If it crashed, include a stack-trace, and the code that's in error.

### Other stuff
+ What version of Reachability.Swift are you using?
+ How is it installed? Manually, CocoaPods, Carthage?
+ Does it occur on device or simulator? Which device?
+ What OS version are you running on?
+ How often does it happen?
+ Are there steps you can take to reproduce it?

Help me to help you!
