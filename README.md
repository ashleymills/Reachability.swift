# Reachability.swift

Reachability.swift is a replacement for Apple's Reachability sample, re-written in Swift with closures.

It is compatible with **iOS** (8.0 - 11.0), **OSX** (10.9 - 10.13) and **tvOS** (9.0 - 11.0)

Inspired by https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability

## Supporting **Reachability.swift**
Keeping **Reachability.swift** up-to-date is a time consuming task. Making updates, reviewing pull requests, responding to issues and answering emails all take time. If you'd like to help keep me motivated, please download my free app, [Photo Flipper] from the App Store. (To really motivate me, pay $1.99 for the IAP ðŸ˜€)

And don't forget to **â˜…** the repo. This increases its visibility and encourages others to contribute.

Thanks

# IMPORTANT

## Version 4.0 breaking changes

### CocoaPods:

If you're adding **Reachability.swift** using CocoaPods, note that the framework name has changed from `ReachabilitySwift` to `Reachability` (for consistency with Carthage)

### Previously:

```swift
enum NetworkStatus {
    case notReachable, reachableViaWiFi, reachableViaWWAN
}
var currentReachabilityStatus: NetworkStatus
```

### Now:

```swift
enum Connection {
    case none, wifi, cellular
}
var connection: Connection
```

### Other changes:

- `isReachableViaWWAN` has been renamed to `isReachableViaCellular`

- `reachableOnWWAN` has been renamed to `allowsCellularConnection`

- `reachability.currentReachabilityString` has been deprecated. Use `"\(reachability.connection)"` instead.

- `isReachable` has been deprecated. Use `connection != .none` instead.

- `isReachableViaWWAN` has been deprecated. Use `connection == .cellular` instead.

- The notification for reachability changes has been renamed from `ReachabilityChangedNotification` to `Notification.Name.reachabilityChanged`

- All closure callbacks and notification are fired on the main queue (including when `startNotifier()` is called)

## Installation
### Manual
Just drop the **Reachability.swift** file into your project. That's it!

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods][] is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. To install Reachability.swift with CocoaPods:

 1. Make sure CocoaPods is [installed][CocoaPods Installation].

 2. Update your Podfile to include the following:

    ``` ruby
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'ReachabilitySwift'
    ```

 3. Run `pod install`.

[CocoaPods]: https://cocoapods.org
[CocoaPods Installation]: https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started
 
 4. In your code import Reachability like so:
   `import Reachability`

### Carthage
[Carthage][] is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.
To install Reachability.swift with Carthage:

1. Install Carthage via [Homebrew][]
  ```bash
  $ brew update
  $ brew install carthage
  ```

2. Add `github "ashleymills/Reachability.swift"` to your Cartfile.

3. Run `carthage update`.

4. Drag `ReachabilitySwift.framework` from the `Carthage/Build/iOS/` directory to the `Linked Frameworks and Libraries` section of your Xcode projectâ€™s `General` settings.

5. Add `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/ReachabilitySwiift.framework` to `Input Files` of Run Script Phase for Carthage.

6. In your code import Reachability likse so:
`import Reachability`

## Example - closures

NOTE: All closures are run on the **main queue**.

```swift
//declare this property where it won't go out of scope relative to your listener
let reachability = Reachability()!

reachability.whenReachable = { reachability in
    if reachability.connection == .wifi {
        print("Reachable via WiFi")
    } else {
        print("Reachable via Cellular")
    }
}
reachability.whenUnreachable = { _ in
    print("Not reachable")
}

do {
    try reachability.startNotifier()
} catch {
    print("Unable to start notifier")
}
```

and for stopping notifications

```swift
reachability.stopNotifier()
```

## Example - notifications

NOTE: All notifications are delviered on the **main queue**.

```swift
//declare this property where it won't go out of scope relative to your listener
let reachability = Reachability()!

//declare this inside of viewWillAppear

     NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(reachabilityChanged(_:)), name: .reachabilityChanged, object: reachability)
    do{
      try reachability.startNotifier()
    }catch{
      print("could not start reachability notifier")
    }
```

and

```swift
func reachabilityChanged(note: Notification) {

  let reachability = note.object as! Reachability

  switch reachability.connection {
  case .wifi:
      print("Reachable via WiFi")
  case .cellular:
      print("Reachable via Cellular")
  case .none:
    print("Network not reachable")
  }
}
```

and for stopping notifications

```swift
reachability.stopNotifier()
NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self, name: .eachabilityChanged, object: reachability)
```
